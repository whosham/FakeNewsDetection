\chapter*{Conclusion}

In this chapter, we conclude the work has been done in the research project and all tasks that have been accomplished.

\section{Summary}
During the research project, we started by studying the blockchain and hyperledger fabric. We designed a real case study scenario that we could use to solve the real problem of fake news by leveraging the advantage of the blockchain features such as data immutability.
hyperledger fabric was used as a permissioned blockchain. We built a fully functioned development network using Docker containers and adopt one of the provided node.js APP to serve our infrastructure and serve as a backend after highly modifying the code to match our case. 
We built a simple Xampp server to allow the users to register in a traditional way using email and password.  
In addition, we implemented a score and reputation system using the chaincode and location trustworthiness. besides introducing an efficient way of storing data on the blockchain by storing only the hash of the media file. we implemented an Android application as end user the application designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Finally, we introduced a modular design thus more features will be easy introduced and integrated. in an interoperable environment.
